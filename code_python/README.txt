Easy_Run.py is a simple menu that automatically runs commands in order to execute
the functions with the default parameters.

>> python Easy_Run.py

IMPORTANT:
â€¢ The program needs to invoke python in interactive mode in order to display
figures. When the program finishes the execution a exception will be handled.
You should IGNORE this EXCEPTION and press CTRL+Z to exit interactive mode and
return to menu. When pressing CTRL+Z all figure window will be closed.

If you want to tune some parameters of the filters go to a subfolder (1.1, 1.2,
1.3 or my_Harris) and read the README.txt.
Its also possible to execute INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS on a IDE like VSCODE or
PYCHARM.
